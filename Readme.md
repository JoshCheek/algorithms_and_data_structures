Algorithms and Data Structures
==============================

Just a place to play with algorithms and data structures.

**These are not authoratative!**

They're all from my brain (memory or imagination),
so if you're looking for something canonical, you should look
elsewhere.

A list of things that might be fun to work on.

* Turing has some! https://github.com/turingschool/data_structures_and_algorithms (a\*, binary trees, linked lists, luhn algorithm, md5, and pathfinding)
* Markdown parser https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/chisel.markdown
* Clean up the "Run Based Merge Sort" b/c it's pretty nasty
* Implement the sorts in-place so that they use the existing arrays instead of requiring additional memory
* Public / private key https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NcDVERzMGw&spfreload=10
* Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NcDVERzMGw&spfreload=10
* RSA Encryption https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgTtHV04xRI
* Gif
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blSzwPcL5Dw               Video about it. Seemed fun, but I fell asleep while watching.
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format Good info, plus examples of the format.
  * http://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt            The actual specification.
* Deterministic random number generators

  This includes the special P and Q that were supplied by the NSA to allow them to figure out the pattern after watching it for a short period of time, thus subverting the cryptographic uses it was intended for -- which they did.
  Great video about that and how the algorithm works here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulg_AHBOIQU
* Binary coded decimal - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal
